                <p>‍Last Updated: Sept 1st, 2023</p>
                <p className='mt-4'>This Privacy Policy describes the privacy practices of CRIPE (“CRIPE”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) and how we handle personal information that we collect through our application, website and any other sites or services (collectively, the “Services”).</p>
                <h1 className=' md:text-2xl text-lg my-4 font-semibold'>‍The basics </h1>
                <p className=''>‍CRIPE allows users to express their experiences, grievances, annoyances and emotions after which they get thoughtful feedback and assistance</p>
                <p className='mt-4'>The CRIPE app permits a user (“App User”) to create a Vent or Poll and then use the link to solicit contributions from anyone with access to the link (the person sending an anonymous message is a “Message Sender”).</p>
                <p className='mt-4'>‍When a Message Sender clicks on the CRIPE link, they will be taken to a URL where they can download the App and be able to send a reply directly to the User. The App User also has the choice to post the anonymous messages and App User’s response to any social media account.. </p>
                <p className='mt-4'>CRIPE does not store the name or Instagram handle of the Message Sender, and cannot reveal this information to the App User or to others. CRIPE may reveal properties of the Message Sender to the App User, based on the Message Sender’s IP address or browser user agent. Additionally, CRIPE may share this information for compliance, safety, and integrity issues. </p>
                <p className='mt-4 text-red-600'>To protect the safety of our users, we employ AI content moderation services like Hive Moderation. These services utilise deep learning and sophisticated algorithms to screen messages and filter out harmful language and bullying.</p>
                <h1 className='md:text-2xl text-lg my-4 font-semibold'>Personal information we collect</h1>
                <p className='mt-4'>‍We don't collect information about you from any source, and the type of information we collect is the anonymous information you filled while on-boarding.</p>
